MASS PRINCIPLE

Artists who write about painting often stress the importance of thinking in terms of masses and the value of a simple organization of the main areas. To create a broad impression in painting or composition, it is necessary to observe the view and the picture with squinted eyes, which helps to create a sense of bigness in the main unity and the relationship of the parts. Proportion, direction of line, values, and color can also be best approximated in this manner. 

The mass idea helps to keep the viewer's attention on the whole picture, creating an abstract interval between the realistic details of nature and the broad impression on the canvas. This interval represents the artist's ability to see nature in a grand scale and to conceive and paint with large brushes using large mass ideas. A broad impression with little detail is an abstract representation of nature.

The appeal of broadly painted pictures lies in the fact that the viewer must use their imagination, allowing them to feel the abstract impression as intended by the artist.

When arranging masses, it is important to focus more on mass and form rather than lines. The quality of holding together through value, mass, and space arrangement is crucial. Therefore, the idea is to lose or disguise lines and edges in order to feel form in terms of shape or bulk rather than outline.

A sketchy drawing is the best foundation for breadth in painting. It helps to develop the ability to grasp the large aspects and translate them broadly, and also helps to avoid the habit of many students of drawing rigid outlines around objects and then filling in the boundaries with color, which is an inartistic habit that is easy to form but difficult to break.

One useful technique in any kind of drawing is to make preliminary marks very lightly, barely touching the surface with dots and broken lines between the main measurements. This allows for correction and alteration without erasure. The mental concept of form is best held when light touches are made between gestures, and this practice also gives confidence and assurance to the artist. Using a sketchy, suggestive drawing as the foundation for painting encourages more drawing with the brush. Drawing should not be abandoned once the compositional plan is made, but should be considered all the way up to the final brush stroke. Additionally, using a sketchily drawn base for painting allows for more opportunity to exercise invention as the work progresses. While it is advisable to have the main plan well established in mind, it is better to leave the smaller parts to be decided upon later. Small details are beyond the limitations of memory, and there is always charm in unexpected accidents. The principle of mass in composition discussed here takes the extreme of this principle for illustration, and is not meant to imply that line has no place in the plan or that the broad mass idea is the only method of composing. Full unity in any kind of picture can hardly do away with line or edge entirely. The mass principle in arrangement merely calls for a maximum, not necessarily the total disguise of edge or line. If the softening of edges or blending is carried too far, there is a risk of creating a "woolly" appearance or a sentimental effect in the work. Nearly all pictures require some accentuation of line or edge.

Emphasizing mass arrangement and suppressing line highlights the quality of indefiniteness at the edge of form, while contours or strong boundaries reveal the beauty, grace, rhythm, proportion, and other linear characteristics of objects.

In seeking to produce one desirable quality, it is possible to find that stressing one quality overrides or destroys another. This ultimately requires each problem to be solved by the individual artist.

When composing, the artist may consider which particular quality they aspire to and use either line or mass, or both, to achieve this goal. If they seek the quality that comes from the indefiniteness of form and edges, they must sacrifice some line. If they prefer the rhythmic flow of line in patterns of line design, they are forced to lose some values in form. If the painter desires to use the qualities that come from both, it is up to them to decide the balance of each.



DECORATIVE APPROACH

It is difficult, if not impossible, to define the decorative type of painting in exact categories. However, it is used here to describe those methods of depiction that do not utilize much recession or modeling, but rather focus on a flat mass design. This style relies mainly on grace and rhythm in line, variety in color, and less emphasis on values.

Decorative painting may depict conventionalized forms or adhere closely to nature. It can be executed in a poster-like manner with all areas flat and unbroken, or with each brush mark separated by visible bits of the underpainting. In this style, form may have strong outlines filled in with spots of broken color, or flat areas may be outlined strongly with lines of the same width, such as in some of Brangwyn's murals. Flat areas may also have softened edges, slight modeling may be used, and some perspective may be employed in certain styles of decorative painting.

The decorative type of painting or composition is not commonly used in easel pictures, but rather more for murals or panels intended for decorative purposes.



LINEAR DESIGN

When composing, and especially when working with linear design, it is important to consider the influence and significance of lines. Lines can be divided into three general categories: vertical, horizontal, and slanting or curved. Vertical lines symbolize great height, stability, and nobility. Horizontal lines denote repose and tranquility. Slanting or curved lines indicate movement or activity and rhythm.

To achieve full unity, every composition should include at least some indication of all types of lines. Often a view will present many lines of one kind without proper opposing support or interception. Unless these dominant lines are balanced, they can create discord in the unity of the composition. Too many straight upright lines without interference may create a static, immobile feeling, while a preponderance of lateral lines may destroy vitality, and an excess of curves may cause the viewer's gaze to wander out of the picture. The term "straight line" is used here in its artistic sense, meaning a line that runs in a general straight direction without mechanical exactness, with edges that are varied by softening and accentuating.

The viewer will unconsciously react to the significance of different types of lines and their gaze will unconsciously follow an unbroken line. The principle of line influence is to create balance and to guide the eye slowly over the canvas, pausing temporarily on the main points of interest and less on the smaller details. Therefore, lines should be intercepted or broken to keep the gaze from wandering out of the picture or to places where it is not intended to go. There is always a way to utilize lines to keep the eye moving in its proper course. Conversely, some interference of lines may be used to slow the viewer's gaze.

The transitory line, or imaginary pathway between objects, represents an abstract element in drawing. These unseen pathways guide the viewer's gaze across the spaces between masses or objects. Objects can be placed on or near the pathway to aid in eye travel. The transitory line adds a distinct quality to any type of composition.

The purely linear motive in composition does not have to be limited to line drawing with pencil or charcoal. Oil paint is also well suited for this approach. Some painters adopt the linear principle in painting, creating beautiful contours and compound curves that are interwoven with straight lines into harmonious compositions. In some forms of linear planning, a variety of grouped lines can be created, and variety can also be achieved by keeping some groups compact while others are more loosely arranged. Lines can be used to create all-over patterns, either with or without a central point of interest.

One quality that should be kept in mind in all linear drawings is compactness. All parts relate more easily when connected by at least a few lines. Isolated parts are likely to detract if they have no connection to the main groups. The linear design may or may not include significant recession or line perspective.

There are almost as many variations on the broad impressionistic, decorative, and linear modes of depiction as there are artists who paint. The intention here is not to draw strict lines between these modes of depiction or attempt to define all manner of working in strict terms. The goal is to reduce the methods of approach to depicting to the least number possible, so that the student can determine their preferences. Everyone has their likes and dislikes, and some lean toward one thing and some another. This is part of individuality. No one can hope to paint or compose in every manner. Originality is dependent on one general course.



PERSPECTIVE

Recession, or the feeling that the picture extends back from the canvas surface, and the feeling that objects have roundness are illusions essential to three-dimensional painting. These illusions are accomplished by consideration of and the utilization of several factors. Chief among these are atmosphere, graduation of values, contrasts of tone and color, the placing of dark and light masses and linear perspective.

Though the painter does not need to adhere to exactness in perspective like the architect, he does have to respect the main principles of line recession.

In beginning the composition, the first consideration is the location of the horizon or eye-level line on the canvas. The station point of the painter generally determines its placement. Normally, in picturing in level country, the horizon would be placed low, although the artist may place it most any reasonable distance from the top or bottom of the canvas, provided it is not in the exact center. Some painters suggest that one-third (of the canvas width) up from the bottom edge is a good average for level country.
