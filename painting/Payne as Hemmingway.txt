PREFACE

Thinking is key in learning to paint.

Beyond natural talent, having your own way of thinking matters most in art. Art grows when shared and reshaped across minds, and originality often comes from rethinking old ideas.

This book shares widely accepted art principles. It is my attempt to clarify the core essentials of art. Art's concepts can't be pinned down precisely; we approach them indirectly. This can lead us far from our starting point, but we must always focus on the underlying principle.

Art isn't just about technique; it involves understanding and applying many elements. A painting's unity is its essence.

Every artist and painting is unique, defying a single rule or measure. Teaching art is difficult because it's tough to encourage personal vision without making suggestions seem like strict rules.

Two things should be clear: 
	2 nobody can give another creativity
	1 the process matters more than the finished piece.

Many expect art books to offer a recipe for making art. I've avoided that, believing understanding comes first, followed by practice and output.

Good art builds on what came before, blending proven truths with new ideas. Without innovation, art stagnates. But new ideas, without a foundation, normally lead to chaos.

While talent matters, logic and effort shape art too. Reason and tradition should inform but not overwhelm creativity. Knowledge and principles should merge with natural talent. Often, painting is about balancing these forces. Even with principles, direct experience is invaluable.

Appreciating art fuels the desire to create. Studying great works helps understand and affirm principles, transcending any one style.

I've not dwelled on art trends, focusing instead on fundamental qualities that define artistic merit. Understanding these basics lets students appreciate true art and ignore the rest.

In essence, knowledge fuels originality and appreciation in painting.





CHAPTER 1: APPROACHING ART

PURPOSE AND ORIGIN

Every act of creating serves a purpose. Knowing this purpose and how to achieve it is crucial. The quality of art relies on understanding and valuing its building blocks. A great painting combines all its parts through composition. So, learning about art involves understanding these parts and their impact.

Art, at its core, is abstract. It hides its rules. We can't tackle art head-on. We must start from the why and the how of artistic expression. Then, we dive into every principle that shapes it.

Art comes from the need to express and be appreciated. This, along with nature's beauty and a drive to excel, fuels creativity. The quest for perfection is a natural outcome of making art. The spirit of competition and the desire to idealize are key.

Idealization stems from the love of beauty and the joy in sharing it, aiming to bring pleasure to others. This love is natural and essential.

Early art was straightforward, each drawing representing a single idea. Over time, artists learned to convey broader messages by combining elements. This evolution marked the beginning of artistic principles.


TALENT AND GENIUS

Talent is essential. It is an inborn skill, while genius is the ability to bring together imagination and practicality, driven by persistence. Sir Joshua Reynolds described genius as a talent beyond the teachable.

Though views on art vary, talent and genius are universally recognized as foundational to creativity. Everyone has some creative potential, but only a few excel in specific areas like painting, showing early signs of their passion.

Interestingly, both primitive artists and children often start with simple outlines and colors, showcasing originality. The challenge in teaching art is nurturing these natural talents.

While talent is a starting point, it alone doesn't guarantee success. Real artistic achievement comes from hard work and dedication. The saying "artists are born, not made" only tells half the story. Talent must be honed with effort and study.

BASIC PRINCIPLES

Art is built on broad ideas. These come from artists' thoughts, their experiences, and the study of nature. These principles are guides, yet they adapt and change. However, the core truths they're based on do not change.

Innovation in art matters, but it's temporary, serving the artist and their work in the moment. The real foundation of art lies in timeless principles that don't evolve but provide a solid base for creativity.

Being original in art isn't about inventing new rules. It's about finding new ways to use what's already there. Real change in art takes centuries and many thinkers to form new principles. These principles must withstand time and fit with the basics of art, rooted in truth.

We often think our ideas are new, but we're usually building on what came before us. The key principles of art were set long ago. Learning from them helps us think in ways that add to our creativity. As Emerson said, ideas often grow better when shared.

Art should always be studied to spark new ideas and imagination. This encourages fresh perspectives. Good ideas are the start of all creative work. Students should develop their own ideas, making sure they are practical and not just copies of existing concepts.

Success depends on how well these ideas hold up over time. Independence and respect for basic principles guide true originality. Learning from others helps us to be different and original.

Art's foundation lies in its principles, born from a desire for improvement. These principles guide imagination, skill, and the emotional drive to create.

To make art, one needs more than talent or genius. An artist must have imagination, the ability to invent, think independently, and work hard. Appreciating quality, having original ideas, and respecting nature and tradition are essential.

An artist's work involves endless study, thought, experimentation, and practice. Art must have a noble concept and balance in its creation. Drawing, color, and perspective are crucial.

Art is made up of many parts, each needing consideration for a complete picture. The artist must decide how much of each element to use in every work. Principles in art allow for flexibility and variation, ensuring freedom of expression.

This freedom is vital for creativity and originality. Yet, it must balance with respect for art's basic rules. Like in democracy, "Liberty under law" ensures that freedom works within a framework of principles.

In both government and art, the challenge is balancing personal freedom with established rules. This balance is crucial but hard to define. Freedom in art means respecting both the natural world and the foundational principles that guide it.

CONTRASTING FORCES

In everything, there's a force, driven by opposites. Positive meets negative, water counters fire, light contrasts darkness. Pythagoras said it best: opposites create a third element, vital for life and balance.

This truth applies to art. Balancing contrasting influences defines its essence. Art lives in the space between ideals and reality, between painting for joy and seeking approval or even profit. The real art is in the balance, enjoying the act of painting most, yet also valuing the reward.

Sometimes, satisfaction from recognition can distract an artist. The key? Love the process, cherish the outcome, but let that success fuel the next creation.

A critical balance is between natural talent and learned principles. Get it right, and you create beauty. Get it wrong, and it's a mess.

Consider the conscious and subconscious mind. One deals with facts, the other with instincts. Pure art might seem a subconscious act, but conscious thought is always in play. Balancing these aspects is crucial.

Nature versus imagination is another battle. An artist must honor nature's truths while letting imagination soar. Composition, drawing, color—all require balancing contrasts for harmony.

Art isn't about picking a side. It's the result of mixing influences. How much of each? That's up to the artist, guided by instinct, mood, and moment.

RULES

Rules prevent mistakes, helping to develop a sense of unity. They warn against pitfalls and bad habits in art. But they're broad, meant to guide without stifling creativity or originality.

Some beliefs in art should remain firm, like focusing on the process, not just the outcome. Wanting to paint well means perfecting all skills.

Freedom in art study is often touted, but blindly following this can lead astray. Understanding art's purpose and respecting its principles are crucial.

Knowledge is the foundation. Applying it wisely is the next step. Opinions on art rules vary. Some see them as strict guides; others reject them outright. The truth lies in between, where rules, when applied correctly, enhance creativity without leading to artistic ruin.

Unlike other fields where rules are rigid, art thrives on flexibility. Applying the same rule to every piece can dull its sparkle. Rules should prevent errors and guide quality, not dictate creation. They're there to help store knowledge and improve skill, aiming for intuitive expression.

IMAGINATION AND FEELING

Everyone has imagination. It starts with reality and ends in dreams, guided by some logic. Imagination fuels creativity, like grown-up daydreams. The best artists see the world with the wonder of a child, as Sir Alfred East advised. But, being childlike in awe doesn’t mean being childish in skill. An artist needs to stand firm, knowledgeable, and strong.

Art requires both emotional depth and physical strength. True joy in painting begins when an artist can freely express natural impulses, balanced by reason and experience. This balance brings a sense of certainty, letting intuition guide the brush.

Just like a violinist feels the music rather than counts the beats, an artist feels the balance in their work. This instinctive feeling, this intuition, is what makes art personal.

Emotions play a big role in creating art. They are like an inner voice guiding the artist. Without the balance of emotion and reason, art loses its soul.

NATURE’S LESSONS

Ignoring nature leads to uninspired "studio pictures." Nature doesn’t care about art; it demands attention and respect. Its endless variety challenges the artist’s imagination far beyond what can be invented from scratch.

No matter how talented or well-trained, an artist always learns from nature. It’s a never-ending source of inspiration and challenge. Nature suggests; the artist interprets. Observing nature, understanding its forms, colors, and moods, is critical. As Whipple said, nature rewards those who study her secrets diligently.

Understanding nature is essential. Knowing the outdoors helps translate it into art that feels real and alive.

BEYOND THE SURFACE

A painting's beauty isn’t just in its looks but in its deeper qualities, hard to define but deeply felt. Art is about mastering the visible to suggest the invisible. It’s about hiding the effort behind the creation, making the rules invisible while their effects enchant.

Beauty in art comes from skill as much as from vision. Craftsmanship matters. A well-painted picture carries the artist’s message better, blending skill with inspiration. In art, as in music, beauty is appreciated through the senses—seeing harmony in color and form, just as we hear beauty in sound.

LEARNING AND PERSISTENCE

Art demands lifelong learning. Knowledge is a journey, not a destination. Even the most skilled must periodically reassess their understanding to avoid becoming complacent. An artist must be both firm in their convictions and open to new ideas. The saying "one is never too old to learn" rings especially true for painters. Every new subject painted is a new lesson.

Many beginners rush to paint, overlooking the importance of mental preparation. Yet, understanding precedes skill. Half of being an artist is developing the mind—sharpening observation, deepening appreciation, and stretching imagination.

To achieve greatness in art, one must think deeply, study relentlessly, and tackle obstacles with determination. From the first brushstroke, composition begins, revealing its challenges. Mistakes are ours alone; nature bears no blame. Artistic freedom and the ability to solve problems stem from a blend of creativity, determination, knowledge, and training.

Throughout an artist's journey, challenges will arise. Solving these often requires returning to the fundamentals. Errors usually trace back to overlooking basic principles. Reviewing these principles often reveals solutions.

Artists sometimes need to step back, consulting the truths of nature, science, and tradition to strengthen their intuition and abstract thinking. This cycle of abstract thought and factual consultation is normal and essential for growth.

Art is a lifelong pursuit. No one ever learns everything about painting. The goal is to gather as much knowledge as possible, study nature regularly, and practice without end.

Nature plays her part flawlessly, so an artist must come prepared with knowledge and skill. Enthusiasm is crucial, but so is balance. Disraeli noted, "Every production of genius is the production of enthusiasm." Yet, unchecked enthusiasm must be tempered by judgment and knowledge. Sometimes, failure teaches more than partial success.

Confidence, when guided by knowledge, makes painting enjoyable and decisions clearer. Hesitation hinders progress, indicating a lack of confidence and negatively affecting the work. Decisions should be swift, actions confident, knowing each stroke contributes to the artist's growth.

Confidence is key, but it means little without the support of well-honed skills and a deep understanding of art.

ART'S WIDE REACH

Being an artist is deep work. It's not just about painting or drawing. It reaches into philosophy, history, and science. These fields shape art, even if the connections aren't always clear.

Burke said art can't be boiled down to simple rules.

Studying art means looking beyond the canvas. Science, history, and philosophy influence art in big ways. Sometimes, ideas come when we least expect them—while falling asleep, talking, or listening to music. It's a mistake for artists to only focus on their art. Life is more than painting. Art enriches life, but so do many other interests.

Artists sometimes dive into completely different subjects. This broadens their minds and gives them a break from thinking about art too much.

Yet, every artist needs to face reality now and then. Great art is rooted in the real world, in nature, and in human life. While art celebrates imagination, it also respects the truth.

We don't learn art's deepest lessons from art itself but from other areas of knowledge. Science and philosophy help define art's boundaries. They provide facts and truths, guiding our instinctive creativity. But they can't dictate how to create a masterpiece. Art loses its soul when bound too tightly by rules or ratios.

Modern trends and shortcuts might promise quick success, but lasting art blends intelligence with creativity. "Mix brains with paint," means thinking critically, not just applying techniques.
