LOUISE BALAAM NOTES

September


October


November
Try making all marks different, unless that's specidically what you're going for

December
No Nouns! Try not to think of nouns when painting (to avoid painting stereotypical ideas of things).
Analyse and plan consciously. But when applying paint, try to let the paint do it and let yourself flow i.e. not think much. 
Excited by sky / time of day - stop and sketch
