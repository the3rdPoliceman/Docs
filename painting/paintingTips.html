                <ul>
                    <li>Plan before you paint. Do a diagram, changing any shapes and adding/removing any elements you want. Crop the image, and note the eye path through the image and the basic shapes</li>
                    <li>Quick underpainting in thin paint to get values of blocks of the painting</li>
                    <li>Start filling in the basic blocks with appropriate values and colors. Don't worry about highlights/lowlights here - just get blocks of average-ish color that color the canvas and get those values more or less correct</li>
                    <li>Start adding variations within the blocks of color, and the highlights and dark areas</li>
                    <li>Analyse the source carefully for sibtle reflections from objects onto others e.g. in a still life there may be subtle reflections from the subjects onto the surface they rest on</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Tint the canvas rather than painting straight on white - any color will have too high contrast against white </li>
                    <li>When adding colored areas, err on the side of too dark rather than too light - it's easier to lighten things rather than darken them</li>
                    <li>Stay as far away from the canvas as you can</li>
                    <li>Squint a lot when observing the subject to see lights, darks, shapes etc. in rough detail. This helps with simplifying</li>
                    <li>TODO: Research shadow colours and warmth &amp; coolness of cast and form shadow to see if there are general rules</li>
                    <li>Things that pull attention. Obvious lines, bright colors &amp; light spots (highlghts), contrasty area</li>

                <div class="h5">The basic process:</div>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNB3XY67Q-I">Detailed video from Draw Mix Paint</a>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Start with something</strong>. Pick colors you think will give you roughly the right color</li>
                    <li><strong>Get the value close</strong>. Use yellow or white to lighten or blue or brown to darken, and choose whichever you feel will push the color towards the target. If it gets to the point you're not sure if the value is too light or dark, thats pretty close.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adjust the color</strong>. Compare the color with the goal and think through the colors from above "which one is more yellow, which one is more orange, which one is more red...purple...blue...green?". If your value moves too far off as you adjust the color, correct the value again before continuing</li>
                    <li>Gradually adjusting the color and keeping the value in check will let you hone in on the shade you want</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="h5">Tips</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Complementary colors will mute each other</li>
                    <li>A color checker is good for matching colors - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ0t5FR9f0">Video explanation here</a> </li>
                </ul>
                <div class="h5">Troubleshooting Colors</div>
                <strong>Too Dark</strong> - yellow or white will lighten it
                <strong>Too Light</strong> - Blue or brown (burnt umber) will darken it
                <strong>Too Vibrant </strong>- mute with complementary color

                <ul>
                    <li>Plan before you paint. Do a diagram, changing any shapes and adding/removing any elements you want. Identify focus, foreground, midground and background elements</li>
                    <li>Closer=warmer & further=cooler. As things get further away, yellows drop out, then reds, so the features further away get colder</li>
                    <li>In general, things get less saturated, the further away they are. This means there is less contrast between light and shodow as you go away. Reduced saturation of the background will help separate it from the midground</li>
                    <li>Value Planes - basically, sky will be brightest, followed by ground plane, hills/slopes/mountains will be next, and finally upright things such as trees or houses</li>

                <ul>
                	<li>Independence of thought combined with appreciation of fundamental principles is needed to successfully achieve individuality </li>
                	<li>Drawing erquires balance of vertical horizontal and curved lines</li>
                    <li>Value is more important than color</li>
                	<li>Color requires harmonious colors as well as contrasts and complements</li>
                    <li>Overdoing dramatic effects is likely to reduce artistic value of a painting. </li>
                    <li>Oversentimentality doesn't make for a great subject. Pretty waterfalls etc.</li>
                    <li>Its better to have a clearly differnet amount of light and dark value area in a painting. See plate XVIII</li>
                    <li>Simple compositions with fewer elements tend to be stronger than overcomplex ones. More simples, less details</li>
                    <li>Simplification of a scene and removal of elements you don't like are standard procedure</li>
                    <li>When modifying a scene you're painting, it's always better to only add/remove small features. Adding or removing large features is asking for trouble</li>
                    <li>A viewfinder is useful when selecting what to paint from nature - it is a piece or pair of cards at which can be used to select a rectangle to paint. Best painted a warm mid grey</li>
                    <li>Squinting is good to see balance of values and to see the large masses</li>
