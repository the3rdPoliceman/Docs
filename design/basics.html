                <div class="section-title-2">Decide the Personality</div>
                <p>Site Personality is important - you need to know where it lies on the scale of fun to serious before you can make any design decisions. It will affect font, colors, border radiuses among other things.</p>
            </div>

                <div class="section-title-2">Develop Systems and Scales</div>
                <p>To limit choices and reduce design anxiety, you'll need systems or scales for everything. It's not that you need to plan everything up front and stick to it â€” you'll still be able to tweak the scales later, and adjust components to use different entries from the scales. But having a list of 8 blue levels or 6 font sizes to choose from, is a lot easier than having unlimited. </p>
                <p>Create a system for as many design elements as possible - these are probably a minimum. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Font face - One or two well chosen fonts</li>
                    <li>Font size - See font page for more detail</li>
                    <li>Font weight - 2 is normally enough. A 400/500 and a 600/700</li>
                    <li>Font color - Generally, 3 grey shades. Other font colors can be covered by color scales</li>
                    <li>Line height - Will scale inversely with font size, and may need to be tweaked for special situations and all uppercase</li>
                    <li>Color - 8 to 10 grey shades, and 6 to 8 shades of each color should be defined</li>
                    <li>Margin - related to font size</li>
                    <li>Padding - related to font size</li>
                    <li>Widths</li>
                    <li>Heights </li>
                    <li>Box shadows - define 4 or 5 levels that you can use from buttons (small shadow) up to panels, up to modal dialogs (large shadow)</li>
                    <li>Border radius - A scale of border radiuses, which will depend on component size, should be defined so you have consistency between components. Size will depend on the playfulness of your interface</li>
                    <li>Border width</li>
                    <li>Opacity</li>

                <div class="section-title-2">Start with a Feature</div>
                <p>Don't try to design everything in advance. Come up with a feature, implement it and see what you think. Iterate the feature and the design</p>
                <p>Designing features has a number of stages
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start with low detail, sketching without color</li>
                        <li>Design only what you need</li>
                        <li>Deal in the definite, don't design for possible future changes</li>

                <p>Initially, ignore the graphic design</p>

                <p>Recognize the importance of each piece of information, remembering that high level information is not necessarily more important. <br>
                    For example, on a bank account page you may have a title "Account Overview". This may seem important as it's the title, but to the user the account balance will probably be much more important - they already know they're on the account page.</p>
                <p>Decide what bits of information are closely related, so these can be grouped together</p>

                <div class="section-title-2">Classify Actions by Importance</div>
                <p>A Primary action is an action that a user is almost always expected to choose - Like a save button on a settings page, or an Add Item button on a shopping list. With these you'll want them to be very obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/S6-q5BheEYU?t=488">Here </a> is a good explanation.</p>
                <p>Secondary actions are obvious possibilities e.g. a Cancel button beside Save, and should be styled similarly to primary actions, but in a more subtle way. Maybe a less saturated color, or outlined rather than filled</p>
                <p>Tertiary actions are expected to be used infrequently. Normally these will have very subtle styling - perhaps resembling a link, or just text</p>

                <p>Group what is related, put space between what is unrelated</p>
                <p>Emphasize what is important, deemphasize what is not important</p>
                <p>Don't rely on font size to create hierarchy - there aren't enough sizes available anyway, and everything all the same font different sizes looks a mess. Using weight, color, background will improve the look and give more options<br>

                <div class="section-title-2">Spacing &amp; Scaling</div>
                <p>Start laying things out with too much space and remove extra, rather than starting cramped and adding</p>
                <p>Don't let things expand beyond reason - you don't have to fill the screen</p>
                <p>Not all elements should be fluid - some things just have a correct size, and should not expand or contract</p>
                <p>Relative sizing doesn't always work at different scales e.g. having title text 3 times bigger than body may work on a monitor, but may be too much difference on a phone</p>
                <p>Scaling buttons requires attention to button borders and padding</p>

                <div class="section-title-2">Creating Depth</div>
                <p>To visually recreate depth on a flat screen the one basic fact to think about is that light comes from above. Things sticking out of a surface are light on top and dark at the bottom, the reverse for inset things. This can be emulated with box shadows and borders. To mimic both direct and ambient light, box shadows can be given 2 components</p>
                <p>If elements are interactive (buttons, drag n drop etc) think of having different box shadows for each state to emulate the change. For example
                    <ul>
                        <li>A pressed button state with less shadow so it appears pushed in</li>
                        <li>An exaggerated box shadow on a dragged element will make it appear to float</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>If you're looking for a flatter UI, you can still use color to create a more subtle impression of depth. Light colours come forward, dark look inset. Another even more obvious clue to depth is when elements overlap</p>

                <div class="section-title-2">Using Labels</div>
                <p>Avoid labelling if possible. It's probably necessary on text input fields, but if data can be presented and understood without labels then do so. For example, on a social network you are unlikely to see "Name: Bob Pratchitt". You'll just see the name.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, if presenting a long list of fields such as product specifications, you will almost certainly need labels</p>

                <div class="section-title-2">Styling Links</div>
                <p>Generally, a global style for links is not useful. How they are styled will depend on how important they are in the context, and how many links there are around. For example, video links in Youtube are styled to be much more obvious than the channel links, because people go to the videos more often

                <div class="section-title-2">Styling Dangerous Actions</div>
                <p>The temptation with dangerous actions is to put them in bright red. This is normally a bad idea - they shouldn't draw the eye away from more frequently used actions unless they are the primary action in the context. A better solution may be a low key delete button with a warning popup that makes the danger clear - like the GitHub system for deleting a repository</p>

                    <li>Empty lists etc. can look weird - think RepCoach without any exercises. A custom empty state - using an icon, explantation, or exaggerated call to action can be useful</li>

                <p>Cool background images with text over are nice, but often your text gets partially into them. This is because the background image is too dynamic</p>
                To solve this, filter your image to lighten, darken, colorize or whateverize it, and allow the text to stand out better to
