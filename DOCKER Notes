When developing, how do you see live updates to your application without building a new image every time?
The -v (volume) command line arg when your running docker, to point a docker directory path to a local path

It isn't. You would need to supply a volume. This can be an external volume i.e. a local directory, or a named volume which is a persistent volume managed by docker

Run docker volume inspect <volume_name>

RUN ls-l
