MILK PAINT  <br>
https://www.woodguide.org/guide/milk-paint-casein/  <br>
Milk paint, or casein paint, is a mixture of quark, water, pigment and baking soda or lime. Milk paint contains only natural ingredients and is 100% biodegradable, odorless, safe and contains no solvents, preservatives or other additives.  <br>
Milk Paint is ideal for decorative paint effects such as old or washed looks on furniture. The coating is not entirely waterproof, so for surfaces that are used extensively or outdoors it is sensible to seal the paint. This can be done with a varnish, oil or wax. Milk paint is easy to make at home, there are various recipes to be found online.  <br>
+ Lightweight, When milk paint is sold as a powder it saves a lot of energy in transport since it is much lighter than paints that are pre-mixed with water or oil.  <br>
+ There is no offgassing of any toxic gasses that could be harmful for the user.  <br>
+ Easy recycling. Non hazardous waste.  <br>
+ Easy reuse. Milk paint is easy to sand and re-paint.  <br>
+ 100% biodegradable  <br>
- Short lifespan. Milk paint can form a resistant layer of colour to wood, but it depends strongly on the type of wood. The paint sticks better to porous wood that hasn't been treated previously. It is not waterproof, so surfaces that are subject to moisture need an additional sealant. Heavy moisture can lead to mold growth, so it is unsuitable for the kitchen or bathroom(1).  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
CHALK PAINT  <br>
https://www.woodguide.org/guide/chalk-paint/  <br>
Most commonly, chalk paint is made by mixing two parts of water based paint with one part of calcium carbonate. It is possible to make at home. It mixes into the paint easily, it has a very good consistency and coverage, it dries within half an hour. Once the leftover paint is stored it keeps the same consistency for days  <br>
+ Low Energy. Chalk paint has a lower energy footprint than water based paint, but still higher than natural paints.  <br>
+ Long lifespan. Chalkpaint, like other mineral natural paints, have good durability (1).  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
CLAY AND LOAM PAINT  <br>
https://www.woodguide.org/guide/clay-paint/  <br>
Clay and loam paint are mineral paints. They are natural, VOC and solvent free, non toxic paints. Commonly used as a wall paint. Clay paints for wood often contain, apart from clay powder, an additional binder such as casein or cooked lineseed oil.  <br>
+ Low Energy. Water based, mineral paints (clay, loam, lime) and flour paint, have the lowest embodied energy among paints.  <br>
+ Low footprint. Clay and loam paint, together with flour and lime paint, are the types of paint with the lowest environmental footprint.  <br>
+ Non toxic. There is no offgassing. It is VOC and solvents free.  <br>
+ Long lifespan. It naturally withstands mold and is highly durable(1).  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
FLOUR PAINT  <br>
https://www.woodguide.org/guide/flour-paint/  <br>
Flour paint has been used for centuries in Scandinavia for painting the exterior of wooden houses. It is a durable and water resistant paint. Original recipes ingredients are water, rye flour, lineseed oil and mining leftover as pigment. The copper, zinc and lead content of the original Swedish paint makes it durable, antifungal, bactericidal, but also toxic. Nowadays other non-toxic earth pigments and oxides are used to colour the flour paint.  <br>
+ Low Energy. Water based, mineral paints (clay, loam, lime) and flour paint, have the lowest embodied energy among paints.  <br>
+ Low footprint. Flour paint, together with clay, loam and lime paint, is one of the types of paint with the lowest environmental footprint.  <br>
+ Long lifespan. Flour paint on exterior wood claddings can last up to 15 years (1). This however, depends on weather circumstances, and quality of the paint.  <br>
+ Non toxic. There is no offgassing. It is VOC and solvents free.  <br>
+ Easy reuse. Flour paint is easy to sand and re-paint.  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
SHELLAC  <br>
https://www.woodguide.org/guide/shellac/  <br>
Shellac is a resin secreted by the female lac bug, on trees in the forests of India and Thailand. It is processed and sold as dry flakes, which are dissolved in ethanol to make liquid shellac, perfectly suitable for sealing wood furniture. From the time it replaced oil and wax finishes in the 19th century, shellac was one of the dominant wood finishes in the western world until it was largely replaced by nitrocellulose lacquer in the 1920s and 1930s(1).	  <br>
+ Non toxic. It is safe once dried and hardened (1). Also used as a food additive. Don't drink from the can, though.   <br>
+ Easy reuse. Shellac finish can be easily repaired on wood products.  <br>
- Short lifespan. Easily damaged by alcohol (it dissolves the finish).  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
TUNG OIL  <br>
https://www.woodguide.org/guide/tung-oil/  <br>
Tung oil or China wood oil is a drying oil obtained by pressing the seed from the nut of the tung tree (Vernicia fordii). As a drying oil, tung oil hardens (dries) upon exposure to air. The resulting coating is transparent and plastic-like, a property exploited in most of its applications which include wood finishing and the composition of oil paints and printing inks. When applied in many fine coats over wood, tung oil slowly cures to a satin “wetted wood” look with slight golden tint. It resists liquid water better than any other pure oil finish, though it still provides little protection against water vapor exchange or scratches. Tung oil does not darken noticeably with age and is claimed to be less susceptible to mold than linseed oil (1).  <br>
Low footprint  <br>
+ Pure tung oil has a low environmental footprint. Non pure tung oil products however may contain only a small amount of tung oil, and be mainly composed by environmentally-heavy oil-based substances.  <br>
+ Long lifespan. Waterproof (or at least highly water resistant on a well maintained surface). Resistant to alcohol. Resistant to acetone (such as nail polish or remover). Resistant to fruit acids and vegetable acids (such as orange juice). Flexible. Oil finishes continue to protect as the wood expands and contract.  <br>
+ Easy reuse. Scratches on tung oil treated surfaces are easy to repair, making the wood product easier to go through many lives(1).  <br>
- Long distance. Tung oil is mainly produced in Latin America.  <br>

BEESWAX  <br>
https://www.woodguide.org/guide/beeswax/  <br>
Beeswax comes from the honeycombs of different bee species. Beeswax is formed in the bees body through the reaction of enzymes and sugar. The sugar comes from nectar. From about 6 grams of sugar 1 gram of wax is formed(1). To make the wax soft or liquid, turpentine (chemically treated natural resin) or white spirit (petroleum derived) is added. Many woodworkers love beeswax because of it’s smell. Beeswax on itself does not provide a strong protective layer. It is therefore often used in combination with oil. When one or two layers of oil are dry, a layer of wax is applied. After 30 minutes the surface should be buffed with a cloth. The surface is then water repellant but not waterproof(1).  <br>
+ Low footprint. Beeswax is one of the most environmentally friendly woodworking material, because it is produced by bees and does not require any additional processing before use.  <br>
- Short lifespan. Mildly water resistant. Moderately resistant to acids and alkali. Damaged by alcohol. Will need to be reapplied frequently.  <br>

FIRE  <br>
https://www.finewoodworking.com/project-guides/finishing/time-tested-finishes-that-just-work  <br>
https://www.finewoodworking.com/project-guides/finishing/how-to-create-a-charred-wood-furniture-finish <br>
Shou sugi ban is a traditional Japanese process of charring cedar on the outside to protect the wood beneath, rendering it fireproof. Also, it allows you to be lazy. If you’re burning off the exterior of the wood, there’s no need to clean up planing tracks (unless they’re quite deep) or sand; the fire will take care of that for you.  <br>
While the process works on all woods, I think it looks best on softwoods that have a clear difference between earlywood and latewood (yellow pine and fir, for example).  <br>
In most cases, it’s best to char your work before assembly (typical shop glues will not withstand this process). Tape off any tenons and stuff a wet rag into any mortises. In other words, don’t burn any of your carefully fitted joints because they will no longer be tightly fitted after burning.  <br>

CHRIS SCHWARZ BEESWAX FINISH  <br>
https://www.instagram.com/p/ChFp1GtD3kS/ <br>
Linseed Oil & Wax Finish Recipe <br>
2 cups (16 ounces by volume) of raw linseed oil <br>
3/4 cup beeswax <br>
2 tablespoons limonene <br>
 <br>
I make this finish in a metal quart paint can from the hardware store. Place the metal can on a hotplate, fill the can with the raw linseed oil and turn on the hotplate to between low and medium. Monitor the temperature with a cooking thermometer. Beeswax melts at 151° (F). As soon as the temperature of the oil reaches 151°, pour the beeswax pellets and limonene into the oil. Stir with a stick until the beeswax melts (it takes less than a minute). Turn off the hotplate and remove the mixture from heat.
 <br><br>
Allow it to cool. It will become a paste after about an hour of cooling. Seal. You can use it immediately or keep it indefinitely.
 <br>
Caution: Whenever you deal with linseed oil in any form, spread the rags outside to dry. Never bunch them up and throw them away. Linseed oil generates heat as it cures. This can cause a fire. Other people dispose of the rags by burning them (this is common in Europe). Others put them in plastic bags with water and throw them away.
