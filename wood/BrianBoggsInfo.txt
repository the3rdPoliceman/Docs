CHAIR CONSTRUCTION DETAILS
Dry wood into wet at joints, then it'll shrink tight as the wet wood dries out

Joining leg stretched to leg. Medullary rays (which run from heart to bark) are vertival in horizontal stretchers. This is because wood shrinks least along it's length, and second least along th medullary rays. So relatively that is the best possible match


STEAM BENDING
https://www.finewoodworking.com/2021/05/11/the-best-woods-for-steam-bending
Air dried is preferable to kiln. Kiln dried is too dry, so needs pretreating (explained in article). Green wood bends easier, but it needs to stay longer in the form, and is more prone to cracking
15-20% moisture is best for steam bending

Some good woods for steam bending (not an exhaustive list)
Red oak, great
White oak, great
White ash, amazing
Cherry, Very good for steam-bending, but only if you use a compression strap. It’s extremely compressible, so it bends well even though it’s not particularly elastic.
