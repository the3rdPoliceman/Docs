Making Sofas
most info from https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/sofa-buying-advice/


FRAME
hardwood or engineered furniture-grade plywood (http://theplywood.com/furniture-grade)


JOINTS
ideally mortise and tenon, but screws etc are possible


SUSPENSION
Sinuous springs is probably best, and polyester webbing is also supposed to be good (webbing should be attached with clips, not staples. I guess the springs are easier to work with
Mum and dads was with pirelli webbing, which also lasted well - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlRYSqGsbys
Eight way tied springs are probably overcomplicated for amateurs, and need specialist to repair


CUSHIONING
Poly-wrapped foam: Layers of high-resiliency foam, a high-response material characterized by an open-cell structure, resulting in a supportive feel that dependably retains its shape over time. A polyester wrap and a tight-weave down-proof ticking surround the foam center, resulting in a low-maintenance cushion that DOES NOT REQUIRE FLUFFING.
The firmness of a couchâ€™s cushion does not reflect durability. But the density of the foam does correlate to the quality and longevity of a product.


UPHOLSTERY
Martindale 50,000+ ideally 100,000 for high use areas (not my airbnb)
There's a pilling scale from 1-5 available somehow


LEGS
Best attached to the frame with T-nuts and large grade threaded rod https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBIM303lrug
