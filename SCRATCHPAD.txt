STEPPER MOTOR INTERNET OPINIONS (MIGHT BE BS)

DM542 better than TB6600
TB6600 better (or at least more powerful) than A4988


PRINTING GEARS
gf gear generator plugin for fusion 360. Double helical are good

MOTOR SPEED CONTROL POSSIBILITIES

3 PHASE + VFD
3 Phase AC Motor
VFD (with modbus RS485 support) to run the 3 phase motor from 220V AC
MODBUS RS485 Communication between Pi and VFD

HOW MUCH POWER DOES YOUR MOTOR NEED?

STEPS
Establish RPM requirements
Measure torque needed
Establish safety factor. This is a factor applied to your calcuation to ensure you don't underpower. With a stepper, a factor of 2 is good. For other motor types, it should probably be less

power(kw) = safetyFactor * ((speed (rpm) * torque (Nm)) / 9550)


COPY METHOD
Look at existing machines. They are probably good, and probably also include a safety factor
