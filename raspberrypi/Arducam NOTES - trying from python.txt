TRYING TO RUN THINGS FROM PYTHON

based on this - https://forum.arducam.com/t/how-to-use-code-to-access-libcamera-c-python/2028


INITIAL INSTALL ATTEMPT
downloaded and unzipped libcamera_python-1.0.1.zip from link on page above
cd into the top unzipped directory
opened the README for instructions
follwed instruction, and as i had python3.7 installed, I ran python3 -m pip install ./libcamera-1.0.1-cp37-cp37m-linux_armv7l.whl


TRY TO RUN
tried to run python3 capture_demo.py
error: ModuleNotFoundError No module named cv2


MAKE SURE NUMPY AND OPENCV ARE INSTALLED (from random internet dude:)
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install opencv-python (this should include cv2)


NEXT TRY
tried to run python3 capture_demo.py
error:
    from .cv2 import *
ImportError: libcblas.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory


ADD SOME MISSING STUFF (from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53347759/importerror-libcblas-so-3-cannot-open-shared-object-file-no-such-file-or-dire, subcomment to accepted answer)
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev libhdf5-dev libhdf5-serial-dev libatlas-base-dev libjasper-dev libqtgui4 libqt4-test


NEXT TRY
tried to run python3 capture_demo.py
    from .cv2 import *
ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to import


UPDATE NUMPY (from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20518632/importerror-numpy-core-multiarray-failed-to-import)
pip install -U numpy


NEXT TRY
tried to run python3 capture_demo.py
Initiated libcamera, but then seemed to get errors later
