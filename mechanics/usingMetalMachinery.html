                <a href="https://youtu.be/a_E-tYRxBkU?t=21">How to drill a hole</a> covers the basics well <br>
                Basics of Marking & Punching<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lines are scribed with a tool that scratches the surface. Two intersecting lines are needed at the position where the holes will be drilled</li>
                    <li>Center punches are not located by eye, but by feel. You feel the punch into one line, then slide it until you feel it in the intersection</li>
                    <li>A good idea is to use an automatic punch to create an initial mark, then follow up with a heavier punch. Punches need to be kept sharp</li>
                </ul>
                Drilling
                <ul>
                    <li>Pilot hole is necessary, as the web in larger bits will be wider than the punch mark</li>
                    <li>Deburr</li>
                </ul>
                Reaming - more accurate than drilling
                <ul>
                    <li>Drill 0.1-0.2mm undersize hole</li>
                    <li>Use cutting oil or wax</li>
                    <li>Much lower speed is used then when drilling </li>
                    <li>Shafts going into reamed holes need a groove near the end, in order to stop locking up. Similar to the type of groove a retaining ring would fit into</li>
                </ul> 
                Boring - reamers don't work in blind holes, and are fixed sizes. For cases where reaming is not an option, a boring head can be used. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Requires a rigid machine, due to single cutter</li>
                    <li>Quality is similar to reaming</li>
                    <li>Bore the hole and then go back and forth once or twice, in case the boring head bent a bit on the first pass</li>
                </ul>

                    <strong>Ball regular vs flat head cutters</strong><br>
                    If you don't need sharp inside corners, specify/use ball nose cutters because
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ball nose cutters cut faster</li>
                        <li>Ball nose cutters don't have small cutters that are prone to breakage</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Milling Speed</strong><br>
                    This has a lot to do with cutter stiffness. As this affects deflection <br><br>
                    <strong>Cutter Stiffness</strong><br>
                    Relative stiffnes of milling cutters is defined by the formula - 
                    <code>Stiffness = k*diameter^3/exposed_length^3</code>
                    So for example doubling the diameter and halving the length of the mill increases stiffness by a factor of 128. This means that the basic rule when choosing a cutter is 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Choose the fattest cutter possible</li>
                        <li>Choose the shortest cutter possible</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Clamping, Moving &amp; Accuracy</strong><br>
                    Design to minimise the number of times the part needs to be moved during milling. This will improve overall accuracy

                    Mating surfaces from milling machines are close to flat, but will still have high points. 
                    The following processes create flatness, in order from least to most flat 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Milling</li>
                        <li>Surface grinding</li>
                        <li>Lapping and scraping</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Making parts flat flat</strong><br>
                    If parts are flat flat, and lubricated, there will effectively be no wear between them, as the lubricant will form a thin layer and the parts will not actually touch <br><br>
                    The possibilities are 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lapping - suitable for small parts</li>
                        <li>Scraping - suitable for larger parts</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Lapping</strong><br>
                    Lapping is done on a flat reference surface and can be done using sandpapers and lapping compunds (<a href="https://youtu.be/cwdoUjynpEk?t=265">Details here</a>) <br><br>
                    
                    Tips:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If parts need to slide, the middle can often be relieved, so less surface area needs to be lapped</li>
                        <li>Use the correct lapping compound - If you lap a part made from softer materials with the wrong compound, the lapping compound will embed in the part - this turns the part into a lap itself.</li>
                        <li>To correct errors in parallelism between the surface being lapped and the top surface, you can increase pressure in the high corner as you lap</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Scraping</strong><br>
                    Scraping seems super tedious and to be avoided at all costs. <br><br>
                    It involves testing the surface for level, then using a hardened scraper tool to scrape off the high spots. Repeat until done.

                Flatness of unknown surfaces can be accurately measured using the <strong>reversal method</strong> (<a href="https://youtu.be/cwdoUjynpEk?t=1362">details here</a>). I don't quite understand how it is working in the examples in the video, but if I did, it would be useful <br> <br>
                The reversal method is also applicable for measuring roundness, runout, dividing a circle. Not sure how exactly
