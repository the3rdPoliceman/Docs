DOG CAGE FOR CARS
Similar to 4pets - Can size based on theirs and use their data about which size car it fits
https://www.galaxus.ch/en/s15/product/4pets-entkalker-vehicle-accessories-for-pets-8393137?gclid=Cj0KCQjw8rT8BRCbARIsALWiOvSWI-w0_2zxfh3GhKcqv2rtBM6Kz-TZNhpekdYkPUCH7EjWXhms4QUaAnj4EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds
They rattleproof evey joint with plastic coupler

Plastic parts:
	3D Printed would be an option, but possibly prohibitively expensive for now
	Low pressure injection molding using heated molds seems very possible. Induction for heating and water for cooling seems interesting - for some details see https://www.ptonline.com/articles/Hot-Cold-Injection-Molding-Which-Approach-Is-Best-for-You  

Design Details:
	In general, reducing the possibility for rattling is very important. Metal to metal should be avoided.
	A compliant mechanism for the door lock could be interesting - reducing part count and rattling. 
		- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMQItryhbl4 is interesting, but complex
		- Something like a rucksack buckle compliant mechanism (built solidly into the door/frame, not on a strap). Fit in the best orientation (with pins facing towards the cage), you could just close the door and it would be "locked" automatically. Examples:
			https://youtu.be/XXlkTab3rno?t=194 buckle
			https://youtu.be/XXlkTab3rno?t=214 buckle
			https://youtu.be/XXlkTab3rno?t=264 battery compartment door
			https://youtu.be/XXlkTab3rno?t=649 camera lens cover
			https://youtu.be/LU77kPf25Yg?t=126 rotary to linear mechanism
			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMQItryhbl4 this compliant handle, but with knob, and using metal attached (screwed, bolted) onto the plastic latch bolt for the part that does the actual blocking

No lock on door of cage:
 	cheaper to make and 
 	safer in case of accidents - less likely to trap dog
 	no need to lock the dog anyway since car is lockable

Gap under cage:
 	Purpose. Allows a ramp to slide under, for older or smaller dogs
 	Maybe ramp could be built in somehow to the cage (tricky though, as boot depth would vary a lot)
 	Ramp could be folded in 2 when stowed and then unfolded in use. Allows longer ramp in smaller space
 	Could be optional, by adding feet under existing cage corner joints
 	Requires stronger base to not flex, or bracing either side of ramp

 Bed:
 	May not be necessary, as owner could supply
 	Could be suspended rather than stuffed for chew proofness. Like this, but brobably takes up too much height: https://k9ballistics.com/products/chew-proof-armored-rip-stop-elevated-dog-bed
 	Should be washable, or not need washing
 	Kevlar seemed like a good iddea, but apparently the fibers are dangerous in cases where the dog eats them

 Aluminium Profiles:
 	Question re 105 degree profiles - https://www.reddit.com/r/IndustrialDesign/comments/10m4coz/finding_aluminium_profiles/
 	Custom profiles - not that expensive - dies are available for around $1000 according to someone on reddit, Minimum order may be as low as 50kg, or more often 2000kg
 	80/20 is a common supplier (also available UK), as is mcmaster carr

 Car paintwork Protection:
 	Fold out flap made of rubber/cloth/something. Flap is attached to the front of the dog box, full width, about 50cm long, and maybe stores under it somehow. 
 	Could roll in/out like a roller blind.
 	Could be spring returned to a flat position under the cage. Would be full size of base of cage. You pull it out, it locks into position at full extension (either automatically or manually), then unlocks and returns automatically via vacuum cleaner style spring winch thingy.

PLANTS IN OFFICES
Supply plants to offices. The office workers enjoy the plants - health benefits etc.
As plants grow they increase in value, and can be sold after a few years at a profit, while occurring no overheads as no floor space / nursery space is required. 
So, it's a win/win
Use relatively high value, hard to kill plants. Monstera, Bonsai etc.
Have a reasonable number of large office customers, so many plants can be visited at a time. e.g. 20 Large offices with 100 plants each



POTTERY
Series of pottery with Japanase Enso circles
Series of pottery in the style of simple curved origami. Like the 1 fold origami. Google "simple origami curved" for ideas



CHAIRS
Ideas
	Rungs and parts painted slightly different shades to add some interest. Or maybe not
Techniques
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzR6mDJwEAQ - ladder maker has interesting technique to put in rungs with a lever thing
Selling Points
	Wood from nearby, sustainable. Lock in carbon
	Wood from invasive tree species would be ideal
	Wood from tree surgeons or storm damage
	Non kiln dried wood - air dried or solar kiln
	Repairability 
		Repairing sticks
			Replacement sticks should be fittable by an amateur without dissassembling the whole chair.  
			Idea: Stick has 2 wooden parts, joined by a bolt. The two parts are screwed together initially, then get put roughly into place and are unscrewed to expand (a bit like a screw out tension rail) and push into the holes
			If a stick breaks, saw it out, then drill out the ends to leave holes, then replace with the new stick. 
			Replacement sticks could be shipped with any tools needed to do the repair. These are then shipped back, and deposit is refunded (If in a different country, these could be shipped to someone I know before picking up in bulk)
Potential Wood Sources
	Maybe firewood - buy firewood in bulk, use what makes sense, and sell on the rest. Maybe can pick up wood basically for free. 
Sanding Device
	https://youtu.be/tI3H3ZjNF0Q?t=389 - interesting spring mechanism in this to keep belt tight while allowing pressure

			Book available but not cheap
		Tree slices 
			Take a slice of tree and get it as thin as possible - flatten it with a CNC or router jig (then maybe with handplane), then sand it until it's very thin, then use a sandblaster to make it even more wafery and see through.
			Possibly for prints also, or as stand alone items
			Maybe present it in a frame?

KNIFE SHARPENER
Similar to wicked edge, but cheaper
Features:
	Off center stone holding, to allow better edge polishing
	Jaws might have padded jaws e.g. leather or rubber, although this needs to be thin. Better grip, and on need to protect the knife
	If unpadded, aluminium is probably good - it is used for soft jaws in vices due to its softness
	Griping faces of jaws should maybe have a slight curve, to ensure contact with the knife is like this 
	 |
	(|)
	 |
	I like the double sided nature of wicked edge. Some extra expense obviously, but no messing with the knife during the sharpening. Plus it means alternating sides with each stroke which seems optimal
	Clamp idea 1: A thumb wheel, similar to belt tensioner on 3D printer, connected to a wire arrangement which has a Y shape (top two prongs connect to either clamp side and bottom to tensioner)
	Clamp idea 2: Thumb wheel with threaded rod coming out either side. Nuts on the threaded rods push the clamp jaws out. (Rod may need to be threaded in opposite directions on either side). Shape of nut and whatever it makes with (i guess some type of recess) needs to ensure allow for jaw pivot and to stop nut rotating. Compasses like faber caastell stream have exactly this.	

Advanced version:
	Foot pedal, via bike cable to pull. Possibly 2 separate wires (one from each jaw) the whole way to the pedal, to allow a bit of left to right finessing with foot pressure to ensure blade is vertical. Maybe this is a bad idea though and single cable is better?
	Blade aligners, similar to wicked edge but on outside of one jaw, so large knives always rest in same position

Materials:
	RODS: Either 303 stainless (better choice than 304 or 316 as highly corrosion resistant. It's main disadvantage is heat resistance, but i don't care about that), or Aluminium which is cheaper.
	GRIPS: 	thin leather, cork, or rubber band https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005003398073303.html
			dycem antislip rubber to make circular pads - https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Dycem-non-slip-film-roll-blue/dp/B006ZL41Q2/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2MVCVFC3I5KKI&keywords=Dycem&qid=1677972626&sprefix=dycem%2Caps%2C191&sr=8-5&th=1



BIKE STAND
Bike needs to be positionable in height, around vertical axis, around horizontal axis from clamp through pole
Along the lines of https://www.efficientvelo.com/tools/ez-lift-repair-stand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iul032uk11c

	LIFT MECHANISM
		Maybe with electric lift. Wireless with buttons on clamp?
		Or gas lift?
		Why? Aimed at electric bikes, weight is much higer than non electric
		Could even run off battery if life was good enough, then no need for cabling over shop floor. 
		A wire pulley lift similar to efficient velo, but looped up around the top pulley, then the whole way down through the tube and out a hole in the bottom where it connects to a winch. In this case it would be good if the rotation locking mechanism around the central post was separate the height lock (maybe there would be no hight lock?) - what you don't want is somebody winching when the rotation is locked. Alternatively, have a very light power lift, or a torque limiter so it doesn't matter. 

	LOCKING/UNLOCKING AXIAL MOVEMENT
		Maybe everything could be done by footpedals - releasing twist in axis 1 and axis 2, 
		Adjustable locking handles from mcmaster carr might be useful - https://youtu.be/2dxCAHU_xpY?t=537 (https://www.mcmaster.com/locking-handles/heavy-duty-adjustable-handles/)

	POLE
		How precise does it need to be to work with bushings?

	EXTRAS
		Mat - maybe could have a work mat as an option with a cutout the size of the base



BIKE HANDLEBAR ALIGNER
	3D print based on this - https://www.youtube.com/shorts/oJcXXnjMKzo
	Could have a push button to turn on the light in the natuarl place to hold it on the bar, or clip on would be even better

	Seat post aligner would be good too



DAVES DONUTS
-Make donuts according to recipes from St Johns Bakery - see PDF Bread Cake Doughnut Pudding, by Justin Gellatly.pdf in google drive cookbooks	
-Googling for youtube videos, there are lots showing korean donut production, high volume efficient production
-Most show hand balling which seems tedious, but this one uses a balling machine - https://youtu.be/kbm3n9xhR0g?t=309	
-Flipping when frying - maybe a metal loop on a metal stem (lollipop shape) that could dip in between the doghnuts, slide part of the way over the donut, then pull up to flip
-Cutting slots - oscillating saw, like Fein. Or correct length very sharp knife
-https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sEaoVaXr41Y has some automation clips
-https://youtu.be/LWpGhfj5J3s?t=59 shows rack for frying

	Advertise with weatherproof poster, 1 per house, that gets collected the next day when coming to do the sharpening
		- Use Weatherproof Inks: Opt for screenprinting inks that are specifically designed for outdoor use. These inks are more resistant to fading and water damage. UV-curable inks are a good choice as they are known for their durability and resistance to weather elements.
		- Protective Coatings: After printing, apply a clear, protective coating over the poster. This can be a UV-resistant varnish or a waterproof sealant. These coatings help protect the ink from fading and the paper from water damage.
		- Synthetic Paper: While you've mentioned using thick paper, another option is to use synthetic paper made for outdoor use. These papers are inherently more durable and water-resistant than regular paper.

	Style similar to https://www.instagram.com/dejan.art.sculptor like https://www.instagram.com/p/Czwfo7MIgIf/?img_index=1
	Using different animals - chickens? His ravens are a good choice - bit mysterious, magic-y - maybe there are others in that vein



COFFEE VENDING MACHINE
	Robot Vending Machine where you can see process happening
	Knows who you are, and remembers your preferences. Learns what you like
	Attempt to perfect all stages, according to rules for expresso
	See James Hoffman videos for making espresso details
	Name: KaffGPT
	Visually displays all data while making the coffee - pressure, temperatures
	Features:
		Load sensors to determine pressure
		Screw driven. Flair machines e.g. flair 58 are a good example of manual machine i would try to replicate - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X84AYoNEQw
		Grind as needed
		Needles to even coffee
		Tamper with load pressure sensor
		Auto washer/dryer
		Heated, insulated head (maybe 3d printed internally circulating oil) to maintain precise temperature
		Heated insulated water tank at same ideal head temp
		Pre-infusion pressure?
		Scale on output for measuring output weight
		Should the portafilter be heated?
		A precision made portafilter basket is highly recommended, and in theory different sized portafilter basket should be used for different grinds etc - see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oFV88PzEFE	
		Saline solution? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PUWQQ-joKE
		What if the head moved in relation to the portafilter? i.e. could then head do the tamping, and then keep pressure on the puck, so it couldn't break apart. I guess you'd have to back off a bit as water started flowing to allow for puck expansion, but maybe not much

	James Hoffman Process:  (https://youtu.be/xb3IxAr4RCo?si=b57AXfszV1YWt50g)
		Weigh beans
		Wet beans
		Grind coffee into portafilter
		Redistribute with needles
		Optional Extraction improvement (may reduce cleanup):
			https://coffeechronicler.com/puck-screen-explained/ has details
			Option 1 - paper filters, top or bottom or both.
			Option 2 - metal screen, top
			Advantages of paper or puck screen:
				+ keeps group head clean
				+ more consistent extraction
				+ dryer, easier to remove puck
				+ minimizes channeling
				+ could in theory reduce need for cleanup quite a bit (both portafilter and group head)
			Disadvantages of paper
				- may be difficult to automate - maybe a vacuum sucker to place, and water jet wash out
				- Metal puck screen would need to be cleaned, although cheap simple version with just holes is good and maybe can be manipulated by magnets?
			Probably paper is better than metal if going this way
			Option 3 - Higher quality basket and rinsing - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzmGNwyN0MI
				This would be the way i would go
		Tamping:
			straight down and up is standard, no need to twist
			tamping level is important
			you need to tamp enough to remove air pockets, but tamping too hard isn't a big deal. 

	Milk drinks:
		Some good steaming info

	Info:
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKA2COJRt6M shows a portafilter with temp sensor, and has some interesting info on Decent DE1

	Setup:
		Could you do everything in the same position? i.e. grind straight into the open top of the group head, then declump, level, tamp in place, add the water and push through 

	Water:
		Water quality significantly affects the extraction and taste of coffee.
		 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfElZfrmlRs
		
		Ideal Water Balance: 
			The best water for coffee is a balance between mineral content and bicarbonate levels. Matching water to a coffee roaster's water can enhance taste.
		Calcium and Magnesium: 
			Calcium and magnesium ions in water help extract coffee flavors. The right amount is crucial for optimal extraction. Generally, slightly more calcium or less magnesium is preferred, depending on which ion is predominant.
		Bicarbonate Levels: 
			The bicarbonate content in water affects its pH balance. High bicarbonate levels can reduce coffee's acidity, but an imbalance can spoil the taste.
		Measuring Water Composition: 
			Water content can be checked via local water authority websites or using dropper kits to measure hardness and bicarbonate levels.
		Water Treatment Methods: 
			Brita filters can improve water taste but are less effective in softening hard water. Reverse osmosis systems might excessively soften water.
		Creating Custom Mineral Water: 
			Ideal brewing water can be made by adding Epsom salt (for magnesium) and baking soda (for bicarbonate) to distilled water. Distilled water in coop is 60C per liter, or about 2 cents per espresso. Might be worth considering.

	Pressure:
		1 bar 	= 14.5PSI
				= 64.5 newtons per square inch
				= 0.1 newtons per mm2

		If grouphead cylinder inner diameter = 58mm
		CSA = pi*r^2 
			= pi * (29 * 29) 
			= 2642 mm2

		so, to get 1 bar in a 58mm diameter CSA cylinder:
			force 	= 0.1N * 2642 
					= 264N
					= 26.9Kg

	UI
		Scan QR Code, then do everything else by phone.
		Registering: Being forced to register could put off first time users, so should have 2 modes:
			Guest Mode: For first-time users or those who prefer not to register, have a guest mode where they can quickly choose their coffee without signing up. They could be encouraged to register post ordering, for a more personalized experience, and loyalty bonuses.
			Registered User mode: Those who have signed up can give feedback which should help make coffee more how they like it. 
				Registered users bonuses: 
					Loyalty bonus - every 10th coffee free
					Prepay bonus - 8 for 10. May encourage increased buying, and maybe would save me money from payment processors fees i.e. one big transaction rather than many small
