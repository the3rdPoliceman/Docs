PLANTS IN OFFICES
Supply plants to offices. The office workers enjoy the plants - health benefits etc.
As plants grow they increase in value, and can be sold after a few years at a profit, while occurring no overheads as no floor space / nursery space is required. 
So, it's a win/win
Use relatively high value, hard to kill plants. Monstera, Bonsai etc.
Have a reasonable number of large office customers, so many plants can be visited at a time. e.g. 20 Large offices with 100 plants each
