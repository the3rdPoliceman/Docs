DOG CAGE FOR CARS
Similar to 4pets - Can size based on theirs and use their data about which size car it fits
https://www.galaxus.ch/en/s15/product/4pets-entkalker-vehicle-accessories-for-pets-8393137?gclid=Cj0KCQjw8rT8BRCbARIsALWiOvSWI-w0_2zxfh3GhKcqv2rtBM6Kz-TZNhpekdYkPUCH7EjWXhms4QUaAnj4EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds
They rattleproof evey joint with plastic coupler

Plastic parts:
	3D Printed would be an option, but possibly prohibitively expensive for now
	Low pressure injection molding using heated molds seems very possible. Induction for heating and water for cooling seems interesting - for some details see https://www.ptonline.com/articles/Hot-Cold-Injection-Molding-Which-Approach-Is-Best-for-You  

Design Details:
	In general, reducing the possibility for rattling is very important. Metal to metal should be avoided.
	A compliant mechanism for the door lock could be interesting - reducing part count and rattling. 
		- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMQItryhbl4 is interesting, but complex
		- Something like a rucksack buckle compliant mechanism (built solidly into the door/frame, not on a strap). Fit in the best orientation (with pins facing towards the cage), you could just close the door and it would be "locked" automatically. Examples:
			https://youtu.be/XXlkTab3rno?t=194 buckle
			https://youtu.be/XXlkTab3rno?t=214 buckle
			https://youtu.be/XXlkTab3rno?t=264 battery compartment door
			https://youtu.be/XXlkTab3rno?t=649 camera lens cover
			https://youtu.be/LU77kPf25Yg?t=126 rotary to linear mechanism
			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMQItryhbl4 this compliant handle, but with knob, and using metal attached (screwed, bolted) onto the plastic latch bolt for the part that does the actual blocking

No lock on door of cage:
 	cheaper to make and 
 	safer in case of accidents - less likely to trap dog
 	no need to lock the dog anyway since car is lockable

Gap under cage:
 	Purpose. Allows a ramp to slide under, for older or smaller dogs
 	Maybe ramp could be built in somehow to the cage (tricky though, as boot depth would vary a lot)
 	Ramp could be folded in 2 when stowed and then unfolded in use. Allows longer ramp in smaller space
 	Could be optional, by adding feet under existing cage corner joints
 	Requires stronger base to not flex, or bracing either side of ramp

 Bed:
 	May not be necessary, as owner could supply
 	Could be suspended rather than stuffed for chew proofness. Like this, but brobably takes up too much height: https://k9ballistics.com/products/chew-proof-armored-rip-stop-elevated-dog-bed
 	Should be washable, or not need washing
 	Kevlar seemed like a good iddea, but apparently the fibers are dangerous in cases where the dog eats them

 Aluminium Profiles:
 	Question re 105 degree profiles - https://www.reddit.com/r/IndustrialDesign/comments/10m4coz/finding_aluminium_profiles/
 	Custom profiles - not that expensive - dies are available for around $1000 according to someone on reddit, Minimum order may be as low as 50kg, or more often 2000kg
 	80/20 is a common supplier (also available UK), as is mcmaster carr

 Car paintwork Protection:
 	Fold out flap made of rubber/cloth/something. Flap is attached to the front of the dog box, full width, about 50cm long, and maybe stores under it somehow. 
 	Could roll in/out like a roller blind.
 	Could be spring returned to a flat position under the cage. Would be full size of base of cage. You pull it out, it locks into position at full extension (either automatically or manually), then unlocks and returns automatically via vacuum cleaner style spring winch thingy.

PLANTS IN OFFICES
Supply plants to offices. The office workers enjoy the plants - health benefits etc.
As plants grow they increase in value, and can be sold after a few years at a profit, while occurring no overheads as no floor space / nursery space is required. 
So, it's a win/win
Use relatively high value, hard to kill plants. Monstera, Bonsai etc.
Have a reasonable number of large office customers, so many plants can be visited at a time. e.g. 20 Large offices with 100 plants each

KNIFE SHARPENER
Similar to wicked edge, but cheaper
Features:
	Off center stone holding, to allow better edge polishing
	Jaws might have padded jaws e.g. leather or rubber, although this needs to be thin. Better grip, and on need to protect the knife
	If unpadded, aluminium is probably good - it is used for soft jaws in vices due to its softness
	Griping faces of jaws should maybe have a slight curve, to ensure contact with the knife is like this 
	 |
	(|)
	 |
	I like the double sided nature of wicked edge. Some extra expense obviously, but no messing with the knife during the sharpening. Plus it means alternating sides with each stroke which seems optimal
	Clamp idea 1: A thumb wheel, similar to belt tensioner on 3D printer, connected to a wire arrangement which has a Y shape (top two prongs connect to either clamp side and bottom to tensioner)
	Clamp idea 2: Thumb wheel with threaded rod coming out either side. Nuts on the threaded rods push the clamp jaws out. (Rod may need to be threaded in opposite directions on either side). Shape of nut and whatever it makes with (i guess some type of recess) needs to ensure allow for jaw pivot and to stop nut rotating. Compasses like faber caastell stream have exactly this.	

Advanced version:
	Foot pedal, via bike cable to pull. Possibly 2 separate wires (one from each jaw) the whole way to the pedal, to allow a bit of left to right finessing with foot pressure to ensure blade is vertical. Maybe this is a bad idea though and single cable is better?
	Blade aligners, similar to wicked edge but on outside of one jaw, so large knives always rest in same position

Materials:
	RODS: Either 303 stainless (better choice than 304 or 316 as highly corrosion resistant. It's main disadvantage is heat resistance, but i don't care about that), or Aluminium which is cheaper.
	GRIPS: 	thin leather, cork, or rubber band https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005003398073303.html

BIKE STAND
Bike needs to be positionable in height, around vertical axis, around horizontal axis from clamp through pole
Along the lines of https://www.efficientvelo.com/tools/ez-lift-repair-stand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iul032uk11c

	LIFT MECHANISM
		Maybe with electric lift. Wireless with buttons on clamp?
		Or gas lift?
		Why? Aimed at electric bikes, weight is much higer than non electric
		Could even run off battery if life was good enough, then no need for cabling over shop floor. 
		A wire pulley lift similar to efficient velo, but looped up around the top pulley, then the whole way down through the tube and out a hole in the bottom where it connects to a winch. In this case it would be good if the rotation locking mechanism around the central post was separate the height lock (maybe there would be no hight lock?) - what you don't want is somebody winching when the rotation is locked. Alternatively, have a very light power lift, or a torque limiter so it doesn't matter. 

	LOCKING/UNLOCKING AXIAL MOVEMENT
		Maybe everything could be done by footpedals - releasing twist in axis 1 and axis 2, 
		Adjustable locking handles from mcmaster carr might be useful - https://youtu.be/2dxCAHU_xpY?t=537 (https://www.mcmaster.com/locking-handles/heavy-duty-adjustable-handles/)

	POLE
		How precise does it need to be to work with bushings?

	EXTRAS
		Mat - maybe could have a work mat as an option with a cutout the size of the base



BIKE HANDLEBAR ALIGNER
	3D print based on this - https://www.youtube.com/shorts/oJcXXnjMKzo
	Could have a push button to turn on the light in the natuarl place to hold it on the bar, or clip on would be even better

	Seat post aligner would be good too

DAVES DONUTS
-Make donuts according to recipes from St Johns Bakery - see PDF Bread Cake Doughnut Pudding, by Justin Gellatly.pdf in google drive cookbooks

-Most show hand balling which seems tedious, but this one uses a balling machine - https://youtu.be/kbm3n9xhR0g?t=309	
-Flipping when frying - maybe a metal loop on a metal stem (lollipop shape) that could dip in between the doghnuts, slide part of the way over the donut, then pull up to flip
-Cutting slots - oscillating saw, like Fein. Or correct length very sharp knife
-https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sEaoVaXr41Y has some automation clips
-https://youtu.be/LWpGhfj5J3s?t=59 shows rack for frying
-SELLING: direct from a mini stall, at basel, bern, geneva, zurich hb. Or through small - medium chain fast food type restaurants

SKI LOCK SCREEN APP (or maybe not just for skiing)
App that can increase what you can do from the lock screen
Original feature is to display a large image on the lock screen, that pans around when the screen is tilted. Motivation is to display a piste map when skiing, so it can be navigated without taking off gloves.
Other features can be ski related too - e.g. take photos, videos etc without hands.
