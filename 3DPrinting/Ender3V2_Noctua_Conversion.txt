UNCERTAINTIES: 
People worry about the reduced airflow of the noctua fans in the hotend/part cooler. Could a larger fan for the hotend be adapted? Like this

Seems like using the 40x20 noctua is good enough for cooling the hotend
For cooling the printed parts, it seems like less of a worry. Too much cooling may actually be a bad thing
