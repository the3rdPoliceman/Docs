GRAPHIC DESIGN	

Should have more emphasis on creativity of image creation, than traditional arts skills

For denoataion, the essense of the object can be extracted by:
Color 
Line
Shape


Approach the limits of denotation. How far from a "real" image can you go, while still communicating what the image is
	Cropping:Think of how close or far away you can get to the object while still recognising it
	Experiment with images that are very different to the object, but are still recognisable


Texture:

Photocopy, Print, Draw, Paint, Use objects, Collage

Iteration:

Try as many things as possible
