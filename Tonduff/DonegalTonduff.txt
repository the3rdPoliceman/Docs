			EXTERNAL ANTENNA
			From Rich - "The neighbours put in an antenna thing on the side of the house to get the best possible signal. About €100 on Amazon."
			External antennas are mounted on the outside of the building and wired into your router. They are specifically to improve the speed of the internet provided by your router. 
			External router antennas come in omnidirectional and directional. 
				A directional antenna creates a cone shaped improved reception area. Seems you point it to a tower to get improved reception.

			MOBILE PHONE REPEATER
			A mobile phone repeater is essentially a localised signal booster. It listens for weak signals and then shouts them out louder. So all phones, 4g routers etc. near the repeater would benefit. As they essentially broadcast, you need to use hardware approved by the regulator. More info here.
