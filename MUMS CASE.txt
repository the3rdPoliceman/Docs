MUMS CASE
  - 2016 - mixed one or two words on holiday - Happy Christmas Market
  - 2018/2019 Diagnosis. At that point, missing a few words and using a few incorrect words
  - 2022 struggling to find a lot of common words (food, clothing etc), and frequently switching related words e.g. year, month, hour
  - Mums type is semantic PPA
  

  OTHER SYMPTOMS
    - headaches for a lot of years
    - trouble swallowing
    - progressively more OCD (not sure if that's almost on purpose, to control things as she faces more difficulty) e.g. kitchen total control (water spot)
    - more common to get agitated about things done "wrong" i.e. not following her anticipated/trained path
    - worrying about less important things - rain is desperate, almost fixated



FATHER'S DENIAL OF OTHER SYMPTOMS
  - He's the main carer/companion
  - heard initially that people can live normally, work etc. and holding on to that
  - fear of word dementia, "it's a very specific thing, only related to forgetting words"
  - not motivated to take positive steps at this stage, in favour of hoping for a solution



TREATMENTS & RESEARCH
  - she and dad are still heavily leaning towards looking for possible treatments (seen Dr Simon Farmer @National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, tried to get referred to Professor Warren at the Dementia Research Centre). They're possibly a bit unsettled about the fact that they're not sure if they're exploring all possible treatment options
  - anything available? She's on a drug from Dr Farmer but doesn't seem to be helping much
  - see research in TDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation) magnetic therapy, but couldn't really find out if it's purely in research stage or developed into a treatment
  - possibility to sign up to be part of research groups for treatments?



DEMENTIA IN GENERAL
  - Is it typical to have other types/symptoms of dementia combined with PPA?
  - See other possible symptoms of dementia.
    - Confusion around needing boarding pass. They took 3-4 holidays a year for the last 10 years
    - Christmas ham - Why have we bought this

  
COPING WITH IT
  - Should we push them towards acceptance, and coping strategies?
- Best strategies (word lists, calendars etc.
