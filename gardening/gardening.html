                <h5>Where should it be?</h5>
                Indoors, ideally with a temperature between 15C and 28C <br>
                Prefers bright indirect light, rather than direct sun. The more bright inirect light it gets, the more holes will form in the leaves <br>
                Ideally, it will face the main light source, as in the diagram below. Front being the side th leaves come out, and back being the root and support side<br>
                <img class="small-image" src="monsteraPositioning.png" alt="">
                <br><br>
                <h5>Watering</h5>
                In general water when the soil is dry, or the leaves are drooping <br>
                This will be roughly once every one to 2 weeks in summer, and once every three weeks in winter.  <br>
                When watering, give it enough water so it comes out the bottom of the pot into the drip tray. Then empty the excess water rather than leave it to grow 
                <br><br>
                <h5>Pruning</h5>
                Prune leaves that are brown, yellow, leggy or droopy. This will also engourage new growth <br>
				Aeriel roots can be cut off if you don't like the look of them <br>

				<h5>Propagation</h5>

                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPeffsP_K5c">This video on potting soils </a> for Monstera has information on soil blends for propagation. Perlite can be bought at Jumbo, Galaxus

				<br><br>
				<h5>Styling</h5>
				In order to control the shape of the monstera, and have it grow attractively, a trellis or ladder is better than stakes or a column as it gives more control. <br>
                Monstera shaped trellis is a cool idea ( although maybe needs a multileaf trellis to really work <br>

                <br><br>
				<h5>Troubleshooting</h5>
				<strong>Yellowing leaves</strong> - likely due to overwatering. Make sure not watering too often, or sitting in water as they don't like wet feet <br>
				<strong>Browning leaves</strong> - lack of humidity in environment - Use a diffuser, use a pebble try, group plants together, or mist the monstera <br>

                <h5>Where should it be?</h5>
                Indoors, ideally with a temperature of 15C and 28C. Doesn't like cold at all, so be careful about cold EVEN WHEN JUST TRANSPORTING it from A to B <br>
                Prefers bright indirect light, rather than direct sun<br>
                Prefers high humidity 
                <br><br>
                <h5>Watering</h5>
                In general water when the soil is dry, or the leaves are drooping <br>
                This will be roughly once every one to 2 weeks in summer <br>
                IMPORTANT: Leaving your dracaena standing in water will kill it. When watering, give it enough water so it comes out the bottom of the pot into the drip tray. THEN EMPTY THE EXCESS WATER 
                <br><br>
                <h5>Pruning</h5>
                Dracaenas love to be cut back <br>
                Where you cut it you'll get one or normally more new stems coming from where it was cut (just like herbs) 
				<br><br>
				<h5>Propagation</h5>
				You can use stem cuttings to propagate new plants, by cutting the stem between 2 leaves - see <a href="https://youtu.be/5RbGKWeD_7A?t=115">https://youtu.be/5RbGKWeD_7A?t=118</a> <br>
				If you chop a stem in two, you can plant the branch in potting mix, and the stem will grow new stems. So, 2 plants from 1.
				<br><br>
				<h5>Troubleshooting</h5>
				<strong>Yellow or brown leaf tips</strong> - may be due to too many minerals in tap water - try using rainwater or distilled water. Alternatively, trim the dodgy end off (trim it into a leaf end shape so you end up with a shorter but normal looking leaf shape)

                <div class="h4" id="pothos">Pothos (Epipremnum)</div>
                <h5>Where should it be?</h5>
                Place pothos in bright, indirect light. They will also tolerate low light, but will not grow as well and may lose some of the variegation. <br>
                Location should be warm, ideally room temperature. If exposed to regular drafts or colder temperatures, the plant's growth can be affected. 
                <br><br>
                <h5>Watering</h5>
                In general water when the soil is dry, or the leaves are drooping <br>
                This will be roughly once every one to 2 weeks in summer <br>
                Signs of overwatering include yellowing leaves and black stems, while underwatered plants will wilt and their potting mix will dry out.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Pruning</h5>
                Use a sharp, clean blade and cut just below a node. Prune close to the crown to create a bushier plant. If you want to shorten up a long vine, snip it off wherever you prefer.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Propagation</h5>
                Cut about 2cm on either side of a leaf node, so you have a leaf, node and aeriel root on the cutting (pic 1). 
                <br>Place the cuttings in a jar of water with the leaves above water, nodes and roots submerged (pic 2), and change the water every few days until a root is well formed and a new leaf has grown (pic 3) - around 3 to 6 weeks. 
                <br>Pot carefully into wet soil initially, as the plant is used to water. <br>

                <h5>Troubleshooting</h5>
                <strong>Yellowing leaves</strong> - most likely overwatering <br>
                <strong>Black stems</strong> - most likely overwatering <br>
