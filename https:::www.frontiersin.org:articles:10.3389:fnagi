TYPES & SUBTYPES of PPA
There are three commonly accepted clinical variants of PPA according to consensus criteria by Gorno-Tempini et al. (2011): 
	- logopenic (phonological) variant of PPA (LvPPA)
	- semantic variant PPA (SvPPA)
	- nonfluent (agrammatic) variant PPA (NFvPPA)

15â€“40% of PPA cases are defined as mixed or unclassified i.e. they don't have all the features necessary to be considered one of the subvariants
See table 1 in the article for details of clinical features, neuroimaging, and pathology of subtypes



TREATMENTS
 Disease-modifying treatments are not yet available for these neurodegenerative brain disorders (Cummings et al., 2018; Panza et al., 2020). Hence, behavioral interventions are the mainstream therapy for patients with PPA. These may consist of two main types: 
 	- impairment-based speech-and-language therapy (either semantic or phonological)
 	- compensatory-based strategies, to maximize functional communication activity and participation levels 

IMPAIRMENT BASED TREATMENT
Lexical retrieval studies are shown to benefit all subtypes. Most commonly, a combination of lexical retrieval therapy approaches has been used, including semantic, phonologic, and orthographic and gestural stimulation, and cueing.
SvPPA patients have more success with a semantically based approach (e.g., description of use or appearance of an object), whereas NFvPPA and LvPPA patients respond best to phonological approaches (e.g., provide the first phoneme of the picture name, rhyming). A combination is probably beneficial.

COMPENSATORY-BASED TREATMENT
There is less research here, but it is often used in actual clinical settings, as speech and language therapists prioritize basic day-to-day communication skills over impairment-based interventions
