Rfissa: A traditional Moroccan dish made with shredded msemen (a type of flatbread) or trid (another type of Moroccan bread), topped with a slow-cooked chicken stew, lentils, and a rich broth spiced with fenugreek, saffron, and other spices. It's often served during celebrations or special occasions.

Pastilla: A sweet and savory pie typically filled with pigeon or chicken, almonds, eggs, and spices such as cinnamon, all encased in layers of flaky warqa pastry (similar to phyllo). It is traditionally dusted with powdered sugar and cinnamon before serving.
